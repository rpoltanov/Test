Part II

In your opinion, when is it better to use POST vs GET requests? Please, provide
all possible reasons why.

1. POST can transmit a larger amount of information than GET. 'POST' has no size restrictions for transmitted data.
2. POST sends information to the server without revealing anything in the address bar of the browser.
